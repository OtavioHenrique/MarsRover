This is a solution to Mars Rover problem that was designated to me at Amdocs job process to Big Data Intern.

To compile this you only need to have JDK installed on your computer.

The fallowing process is to compile on UNIX Systems.

You can install JDK on the fallowing link:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/linux_jdk.html

After install JDK you only need to open your terminal on the location of this folder and call the java compiler, like this:

$ javac *.java

And after this its only execute:

$ java Main

After this the program you ask you a path for a file, this file is a txt that contain the test:
(On this file I insert the ttest that was sent mw with the problem:
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
)

After this you only need to wait for the answer, that should be printed:

1 3 N
5 1 E

And all will be ok :)

To solve this problem I used OO and Java, and git as version manager, all this solution you can find on my Github
personal page, and I will delete this repository from my profile in almost 48 hours, on January 7th.

You can find it on my Github Personal Profile:

Or clone it on the fallowing links:

SSH: git@github.com:OtavioHenrique/MarsRover.git
HTTPS: https://github.com/OtavioHenrique/MarsRover.git

Its only have git installed on your computer and use the "git clone" command and those links.

Have a nice day, and a good year.
